Autocomplete is an important part of the typing experience, where suggestions are shown as the user types.

In KeyboardKit, an ``AutocompleteProvider`` can provide suggestions to an ``AutocompleteContext`` whenever the user types. Unlike other service types, there is no open-source implementation of this protocol.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks local and remote autocomplete. Information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.

## Autocomplete namespace

KeyboardKit has an ``Autocomplete`` namespace that contains autocomplete-related types, models and views.



## Autocomplete context

KeyboardKit has an observable ``AutocompleteContext`` that handles autocomplete state, such as if autocomplete is enabled, which suggestions to present, etc.

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class, injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/state`` and updates it whenever autocomplete is performed.



## Autocomplete providers

In KeyboardKit, an ``AutocompleteProvider`` can provide suggestions when the user types or the text input cursor moves in the text.

KeyboardKit doesn't have a standard autocomplete provider implementation. Instead, it injects a disabled provider into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` until you replace it with a custom provider or activate KeyboardKit Pro.



## How to perform autocomplete

KeyboardKit will automatically call ``KeyboardController/performAutocomplete()`` whenever the keyboard text changes, then update the ``KeyboardInputViewController/state`` context with suggestions from the ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` autocomplete provider.

Views like the autocomplete ``Autocomplete/Toolbar`` can list these suggestions and handle suggestion with the main ``KeyboardActionHandler``.



## How to disable autocomplete and autocorrect

You can use ``AutocompleteContext/isAutocorrectEnabled`` to disable autocorrection, and ``AutocompleteContext/isAutocompleteEnabled`` to disable autocomplete. You can also disable autocorrection by applying a ``SwiftUI/View/autocorrectionDisabled(with:)`` modifier to the keyboard view.



## How to customize the autocomplete behavior

You can customize the autocomplete behavior by replacing the ``AutocompleteProvider`` in ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` with a custom provider. You can also customize the ``KeyboardInputViewController`` to change the autocomplete behavior.

For instance, the controller's ``KeyboardInputViewController/autocompleteText`` property is used to determine which text to use for autocomplete. You can override it to customize which text to use, without having to create a custom autocomplete provider.



## How to create a custom autocomplete provider

You can create a custom autocomplete provider to customize the autocomplete behavior, to integrate with 3rd party tools, etc. You can implement ``AutocompleteProvider`` from scratch, or inherit and customize any of the [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] providers. 

For instance, here's a custom provider that just adds a suffix to the provided text's current word:

```swift
class CustomAutocompleteProvider: AutocompleteProvider {

    init(match: String = "match") {
        self.match = match
    }

    private var match: String
    
    var locale: Locale = .current
    
    var canIgnoreWords: Bool { false }
    var canLearnWords: Bool { false }
    var ignoredWords: [String] = []
    var learnedWords: [String] = []
    
    func hasIgnoredWord(_ word: String) -> Bool { false }
    func hasLearnedWord(_ word: String) -> Bool { false }
    func ignoreWord(_ word: String) {}
    func learnWord(_ word: String) {}
    func removeIgnoredWord(_ word: String) {}
    func unlearnWord(_ word: String) {}
    
    func autocompleteSuggestions(
        for text: String
    ) async throws -> [Autocomplete.Suggestion] {
        guard text.count > 0 else { return [] }
        if text == match {
            return matchSuggestions()
        } else {
            return fakeSuggestions(for: text)
        }
    }
}

private extension CustomAutocompleteProvider {
    
    func fakeSuggestions(for text: String) -> [Autocomplete.Suggestion] {
        [
            .init(text: text, isUnknown: true),
            .init(text: text, isAutocorrect: true),
            .init(text: text, subtitle: "Subtitle")
        ]
    }
    
    func fakeSuggestion(_ text: String, _ subtitle: String? = nil) -> Autocomplete.Suggestion {
        .init(text: text, subtitle: subtitle)
    }

    func matchSuggestions() -> [Autocomplete.Suggestion] {
        [
            .init(text: match, isUnknown: true),
            .init(text: match, isAutocorrect: true),
            .init(text: match),
        ]
    }
}
```

To use this handler instead of the standard one, just inject it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        services.actionHandler = CustomActionHandler(inputViewController: self)
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
}
```

This will make KeyboardKit use your custom implementation instead of the standard one.



## Views

The ``Autocomplete`` namespace has autocomplete-specific views, that can be used to mimic native autocomplete toolbars and items.

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("Toolbar") {
        
        The autocomplete ``Autocomplete/Toolbar`` mimics a native autocomplete toolbar, and can be used to present autocomplete suggestions to the user:
        
        @Row {
            @Column {}
            @Column(size: 2) {
                ![AutocompleteToolbar](autocompletetoolbar)
            }
            @Column {}
        }
        
        This view can be styled with a ``Autocomplete/ToolbarStyle``, which can be applied with the ``SwiftUI/View/autocompleteToolbarStyle(_:)`` view modifier. It can also use custom ``Autocomplete/ToolbarItem`` & ``Autocomplete/ToolbarSeparator`` views.
    }
    
    @Tab("ToolbarItem") {
        
        The autocomplete-specific ``Autocomplete/ToolbarItem`` and ``Autocomplete/ToolbarSeparator`` views can be used to customize the autocomplete ``Autocomplete/Toolbar``:
        
        @Row {
            @Column {}
            @Column(size: 2) {
                ![AutocompleteToolbar](autocompletetoolbar)
            }
            @Column {}
        }
        
        These views can be styled with the ``Autocomplete/ToolbarItemStyle`` and ``Autocomplete/ToolbarSeparatorStyle`` styles, which can be applied with the ``SwiftUI/View/autocompleteToolbarItemStyle(_:)`` and ``SwiftUI/View/autocompleteToolbarSeparatorStyle(_:)`` view modifiers.
    }
}


## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks additional autocomplete providers and injects a ``Autocomplete/LocalProvider`` into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` when you register a valid license key. These providers are open to inheritance, so you can inherit and customize them to fit your needs.


### Local Autocomplete

The ``Autocomplete/LocalProvider`` performs autocomplete operations locally, on-device. It supporst most keyboard locales, works offline, doesn't require Full Access and can integrate with system services, like the local lexicon.

> Important: This provider currently doesn't provide next word prediction, since Apple removed these capabilities in iOS 16. 


### Remote Autocomplete

The ``Autocomplete/RemoteProvider`` can be used to perform autocomplete by integrating with an external API. It requires that the device is online, and requires that Full Access is enabled, to allow it to make network requests.


### Supported Locales

The ``Autocomplete/LocalProvider`` that is unlocked by KeyboardKit Pro supports the following locales:

``KeyboardLocale/arabic``, ``KeyboardLocale/bulgarian``, ``KeyboardLocale/czech``, ``KeyboardLocale/danish``, ``KeyboardLocale/dutch``, ``KeyboardLocale/dutch_belgium``, ``KeyboardLocale/english``, ``KeyboardLocale/english_gb``, ``KeyboardLocale/english_us``, ``KeyboardLocale/filipino``, ``KeyboardLocale/finnish``, ``KeyboardLocale/french``, ``KeyboardLocale/french_belgium``, ``KeyboardLocale/french_switzerland``, ``KeyboardLocale/german``, ``KeyboardLocale/german_austria``, ``KeyboardLocale/german_switzerland``, ``KeyboardLocale/greek``, ``KeyboardLocale/hebrew``, ``KeyboardLocale/hungarian``, ``KeyboardLocale/irish``, ``KeyboardLocale/italian``, ``KeyboardLocale/norwegian``, ``KeyboardLocale/polish``, ``KeyboardLocale/portuguese_brazil``, ``KeyboardLocale/portuguese``, ``KeyboardLocale/romanian``, ``KeyboardLocale/russian``, ``KeyboardLocale/spanish``, ``KeyboardLocale/swedish``, ``KeyboardLocale/turkish``, ``KeyboardLocale/ukrainian``.

If you want to use autocomplete with other locales, you must use remote autocomplete or implement a custom recognizer.
