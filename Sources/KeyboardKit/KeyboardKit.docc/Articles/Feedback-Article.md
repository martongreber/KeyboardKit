Feedback is an important part of the typing experience, where a keyboard can trigger audio and haptic feedback when a user taps on a key or performs certain actions.

In KeyboardKit, audio and haptic feedback can be triggered with a ``KeyboardActionHandler`` or by using the ``Feedback/Audio`` and ``Feedback/Haptic`` ``Feedback/Audio/trigger()`` functions directly.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a convenient feedback toggle view, that lets you toggle between the last enabled feedback and a disabled configuration. Information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article.



## Feedback Namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``Feedback`` namespace with feedback-related types, like ``Feedback/Audio``, ``Feedback/Haptic``, etc.



## Audio feedback

KeyboardKit has an ``Feedback/Audio`` feedback enum that defines various standard audio feedback types, like ``Feedback/Audio/input``, ``Feedback/Audio/system``, ``Feedback/Audio/delete``, etc.

This enum also serves as a namespace for other audio feedback-related types like ``Feedback/AudioConfiguration`` and ``Feedback/AudioEngine``.



## Haptic feedback

KeyboardKit has an ``Feedback/Haptic`` feedback enum that defines various standard haptic feedback types, like ``Feedback/Haptic/success``, ``Feedback/Haptic/warning``, etc.

This enum also serves as a namespace for other haptic feedback-related types like ``Feedback/HapticConfiguration`` and ``Feedback/HapticEngine``.



## How to trigger feedback

You can trigger any ``Feedback/Audio`` and ``Feedback/Haptic`` feedback with the ``Feedback/Audio/trigger()`` enum functions:

```swift
Feedback.Audio.input.trigger()
Feedback.Haptic.success.trigger()
```

You can also trigger feedback with a ``KeyboardActionHandler``, using ``KeyboardActionHandler/triggerFeedback(for:on:)``. You can either use the feedback configuration described below to customize the feedback, or create a custom action handler. 



## How to configure feedback

KeyboardKit has an observable ``FeedbackContext`` that can be used to configure feedback for various actions. 

KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class and injects it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``. You can use this instance to configure feedback:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        let feedback = state.feedbackContext 
        feedback.audioConfiguration = .enabled
        feedback.audioConfiguration.input = .custom(id: 1329)
        feedback.hapticConfiguration = .enabled
    }
}
```

You can also use use the context or its underlying configurations to register custom feedback for any gesture on any action.

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        ...
        feedback.register(.audio(.rocketFuse, for: .press, on: .rocket))
        feedback.register(.audio(.rocketLaunch, for: .release, on: .rocket))
        feedback.register(.haptic(.selection, for: .repeat, on: .rocket))
    }
}
```

Since the configuration is observable, any changes will automatically cause the keyboard to update, e.g. if you have feedback toggles.



## How to define custom audio feedback

Since ``Feedback/Audio`` uses **AudioServices** to play audio, you can use any system audio ID (see [this website](https://iphonedev.wiki/index.php/AudioServices) for info) as feedback. 

For instance, this is a way to define a custom sound:

```swift
extension Feedback.Audio {

    static let sentMessage = .custom(id: 1004)
}
```

You can also use the ``Feedback/Audio/customUrl(_:)`` enum case to define custom audio feedback that loads the sound effect from an audio file.

You can also implement a custom action handler to trigger feedback in a different ways. See the <doc:Actions-Article> article for more information.



## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks a convenient feedback toggle that can be added to a keyboard toolbar to toggle audio or haptic feedback.

[Pro]: https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKitPro

### Views

KeyboardKit Pro unlocks views in the ``FeedbackConfiguration`` namespace, that let you easily toggle audio and haptic feedback:

@TabNavigator {
    
    @Tab("Toggle") {
        
        The feedback ``Feedback/Toggle`` can be used to toggle audio & haptic feedback on and off. It can be added to a toolbar, or anywhere you want it.
        
        ![FeedbackToggle](feedbackconfigurationtoggle)
        
        The view can be customized with other icons, and be further styled with native accent colors, fonts, etc. It's currently not style-based.
        
        Note that this toggle will use ``FeedbackContext/toggleIsAudioFeedbackEnabled()`` and ``FeedbackContext/toggleIsHapticFeedbackEnabled()``, which will toggle between a disabled configuration and the *last enabled* configuration. Haptic feedback uses a minimal configuration by default. 
    }
}
