# Host Utilities

This article describes how KeyboardKit can identify the host application.

KeyboardKit provides ways to easily identify the host application, which may be of interest for many reasons, e.g. to vary the style of functionality of a keyboard based on the active app.

ðŸ‘‘ [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks an additional list of popular host applications, to make it even easier to identify the active app.



## Host Application Bundle Identifier

``KeyboardInputViewController`` has a ``KeyboardInputViewController/hostApplicationBundleId`` property that tries to resolve the bundle identifier for the application that is currently using the keyboard.

``KeyboardContext`` also has a ``KeyboardContext/hostApplicationBundleId`` property that is kept in sync with the controller. Since you should not pass around the controller instance, this property may be more convenient to use.



## ðŸ‘‘ KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks more ways to identify the current host application.

KeyboardKit Pro Gold unlocks a ``KeyboardHostApplication`` enum that defines many commonly used applications. This enum will be expanded over time, so please reach out if you're missing a certain app.

KeyboardKit Pro also extends ``KeyboardInputViewController`` and ``KeyboardContext`` with a `hostApplication` property, that tries to map the raw bundle identifier to a ``KeyboardHostApplication`` value.
