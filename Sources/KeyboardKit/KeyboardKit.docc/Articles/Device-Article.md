# Device Utilities

This article describes the KeyboardKit device utilities.

KeyboardKit has device-related features that can help customize your keyboard for various devices.

Although you should avoid designing for a specific device, orientation, or screen size, some features do need these considerations.



## Device type

KeyboardKit has a platform-agnostic ``DeviceType`` enum that defines available device types. 

You can use ``DeviceType/current`` to get the current device type:

```swift
let isPad = DeviceType.current == .pad
```



## Interface orientation

KeyboardKit has a platform-agnostic ``InterfaceOrientation`` enum that defines various interface (screen) orientations. 

You can use ``InterfaceOrientation/current`` to get the current interface orientation:

```swift
let isPortrait = InterfaceOrientation.current.portrait
```



## Screen sizes

KeyboardKit has CGSize extensions for detecting which kind of hardware you're on, for instance to define and compare various device screen sizes. Tap the link for more information.

It's important to avoid designing for a specific screen size, since apps can run in split screen, a keyboard can be floating, etc. However, the screen size may provide you with information about the device.
