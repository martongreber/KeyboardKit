## About KeyboardKit

KeyboardKit is a Swift SDK that lets you create fully customizable keyboards in a few lines of code, using SwiftUI.

KeyboardKit extends Apple's native APIs and provides you with a lot more functionality. It lets you mimic the native iOS keyboard and tweak its style and behavior, or create completely custom keyboards.

</p>

Custom iOS keyboard extensions can be used with all other apps that support text input. It's the only way for your product, brand or technology to directly interact with other apps on iOS. Don't miss out!

KeyboardKit can be used in different ways. Keyboard extensions can use it to create custom keyboards. Apps can use it to check keyboard and full access status, provide settings etc.



## Installation

KeyboardKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit.git
```

After installing KeyboardKit, make sure to link it to all targets that need it.



## Getting Started

After installing KeyboardKit, just make your `KeyboardViewController` inherit ``KeyboardInputViewController`` instead of `UIInputViewController`:

```swift
import KeyboardKit

class KeyboardController: KeyboardInputViewController {}
```

This gives your controller access to new lifecycle functions like `viewWillSetupKeyboard`, observable state like `state.keyboardContext`, services like `services.actionHandler`, and much more.

If you just want to use the default `SystemKeyboard` view, which mimics a native iOS keyboard, you don't have to do anything else. KeyboardKit will set up everything.

To replace or customize the default `SystemKeyboard`, just override `viewWillSetupKeyboard` and call `setup` with a `view` builder:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewWillSetupKeyboard() {
        super.viewWillSetupKeyboard()
        setup { [weak self] controller in // <-- Use [weak self] or [unowned self] if you need self here.
            SystemKeyboard(
                state: controller.state,
                services: controller.services,
                buttonContent: { $0.view },
                buttonView: { $0.view },
                emojiKeyboard: { $0.view },
                toolbar: { _ in MyCustomToolbar() }
            )
        }
    }
}
```

For more information, please see the [getting started guide][Getting-Started].
